- using blender for editing models, and collision
    - the move is to import a complex model, edit over it with basic boxes for collision

- using sketchfab for the free complex models
            - used to use https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx for importing the models and textures
            - is shit
    - not totally sure if it helps, but got the model to show up
    - requires setting the lighting settings in main.
